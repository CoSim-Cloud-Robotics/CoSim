# Monaco → VS Code Parity Checklist (UI/UX Adaptations)

- [x] **Theme + Tokens**: Import VS Code’s default Dark+ theme JSON (including semantic token colors) and feed to `monaco.editor.defineTheme`; verify bracket pair colors, selection highlight, line highlight, and inactive selection match VS Code. (Implemented in `SessionIDE` with an inline Dark+ theme.)
- [x] **Editor Layout & Chrome**: Match padding/margins (same line height, letter spacing, cursor width), render line numbers at VS Code’s width, enable indent guides, bracket guides, folding gutters, overview ruler, and minimap sizing identical to VS Code defaults. (Monaco options now set for guides, rulers, minimap, padding, line number widths, cursor/scroll, sticky scroll, bracket colorization.)
- [x] **Tab/Title UX**: Replicate VS Code tab styling—dirty indicators, close icons, scrollable/shrinking tabs, active underline, and breadcrumb bar above the editor.
- [x] **Command Palette & Keybindings**: `Ctrl/Cmd+Shift+P` opens a Monaco command palette with core actions (theme, minimap, format, save, rename, go to/peek definition, references, toggle comment, add-next-occurrence, go-to-symbol/line, Problems/Output/Terminal toggles, find/replace, quick-fix). Keybindings: `Shift+Alt+F`, F2/F12/Alt+F12/Shift+F12, Ctrl+D, Ctrl+/, Ctrl+., Ctrl/Cmd+` for terminal toggle, F8/Shift+F8 for problem navigation.
- [x] **Explorer Panel**: Icons/selection styling match VS Code, context menu and keyboard support new file/folder, rename, delete, and focus/arrow navigation. Remaining: drag/drop ordering (non-blocking).
- [x] **Panels/Status Bar**: Bottom bar shows cursor, encoding/EOL/indent, language, minimap/theme status, workspace/session, live Problems count, and Git-style change summary. Panel toggles for Problems/Output/Terminal; Problems panel lists Monaco markers with navigation; Output panel surfaces task output; terminal toggle via Ctrl/Cmd+`.
- [x] **Diff/Peek Views**: Dark+ theme now includes diff/peek colors; gutter + overview ruler markers mirror VS Code. Peek bindings (Alt+F12, Shift+F12) and marker navigation (F8/Shift+F8) wired.
- [x] **Diagnostics & Inline Hints**: Squiggle/marker colors set in theme, Problems panel clickable, quick-fix action on Ctrl/Cmd+. Inlay hint colors align to VS Code defaults.
- [x] **Find/Replace UX**: Theme colors for find highlights; command palette entries for Find/Replace; default Monaco find/replace widget surfaced via shortcuts.
- [x] **Terminal Embedding**: Integrated terminal wired with panel toggles and Ctrl/Cmd+` shortcut; status bar shows panel state; Output/Debug placeholders mirror VS Code layout.
- [x] **Git Decorations**: Gutter decorations (added/modified/deleted) and overview ruler markers derived from saved-vs-current diff; status bar shows +/~/- counts; Source Control activity shows summary and nudges to use git via terminal.
- [x] **SCM & Git Commands**: Source Control side panel displays change summary; integrated terminal supports git CLI. Decorations update live as files diverge from saved state.
- [x] **Accessibility & UX Polish**: File tree now keyboard-navigable (Enter/arrow/F2/Delete), focusable nodes, and command palette/Problems navigation via keyboard; sticky scroll, smooth scrolling, and word wrap match VS Code defaults.
